# Stock-Analysis-In-Python

In this notebook, I aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of four prominent stocks: Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Disney (DIS), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). By employing a combination of data science techniques and financial metrics, I will delve into the historical performance of these companies, assess their risk-return profiles, and identify potential patterns and relationships.

*Methodology:*

The analysis will encompass the following steps for each stock:

- Data Acquisition: Retrieve historical stock price data for the specified period.
- Descriptive Statistics: Calculate essential statistical measures including standard deviation, kurtosis, and skewness of daily returns.
- Return Analysis: Compute daily and cumulative returns to understand price fluctuations over time.
- Distribution Analysis: Visualize the distribution of daily returns using histograms and explore their characteristics.
- Correlation Analysis: Examine the relationships between the four stocks using pairplots and correlation matrices.
- Risk and Return Analysis: Calculate beta, alpha, and Sharpe ratio to assess the risk-adjusted performance of each stock.

By systematically applying these analyses, I aim to gain valuable insights into the investment behavior of these tech giants and provide a foundation for further financial modeling and decision-making.
